# Nomis
This is a clone of the game "Simon", a popular toy in the 70's and 80's. Made entirely in Unity.
Made very quickly as a proof of concept, I should probably go back and make it better but I didn't fix it then so I will leave it.

# Known Bugs:
  1. When you hit P if it's already playing back, it will repeat playback.
  2. The score counter is delayed by 1. 
      (If you get it wrong it updates your score to the current level you're on, as level 1 says Score 0 to start)
    
# Usage
  Downloading the zip file should contain all materials require to start the game.
