# Nomis
This is a clone of the game "Simon", a popular toy in the 70's and 80's. Made entirely in Unity.

Known Bugs:
  1. When you hit P if it's already playing back, it will repeat playback.
  2. The score counter is delayed by 1. 
      (If you get it wrong it updates your score to the current level you're on, as level 1 says Score 0 to start)
